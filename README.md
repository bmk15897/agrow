## Description

### What's the problem?

Currently there are 150 million farmers in India and Agriculture is the primary occupation of 58% of the population. However, farmers are struggling for a decent economic growth. They have very limited guidance available on several aspects like crop diversification, modern farming techniques. 

### How can technology help?

We propose AGROW as a solution which is a multiplatform enabled application that enables farmers to plan their yield in an efficient and cost effective manner while maximizing earnings. It is a multilingual application, available in all regional languages in India. An easy to use application, which is accessible via a Chabot and on computer browsers. It eliminates the need of downloading another app and significantly saves time by excluding call-waiting times. 

It sources most recent data from Open Government data platforms thus
Improving query resolution. AGROW considers geographical mapping and provides seasonal crop recommendations based on current market trends and prices. This in turn enables crop diversification. It will eventually be a centralized data source, which enables analytical and statistical conclusions. 

AGROW would also support some key suitability goals like No Poverty and Decent Economic Growth.

### AGROW Sustainability

The application will be free cost for the farmers for the first 6 months (from the date of registration) so we can build a customer base. Post which we plan to charge a subscription fee from them on a half-yearly/yearly basis and in parallel explore opportunities to tie-up with government services and NGOs.

### The idea

AGROW, a solution to maximise producitvity, enable crop diversification and assist in better planning of harvest and improved ROI planner for the farmers.
